title: Official Packages

Since Buckaroo works directly from Git, we don't know how many packages are in the wild!

However, we have a collection of [official packages](https://github.com/buckaroo-pm) over at Buckaroo PM. 

If you cannot find the package you need, create an issue over on [the wishlist](https://github.com/LoopPerfect/buckaroo-wishlist) and we will take a look! 

If you have an issue with a particular package (e.g. a compilation error), please create an issue on that particular package.
